## Release process

To publish a new version to JSR and GitHub Releases:

1. Make sure your changes are pushed to the `main` branch and CI passes (tests, lint, fmt).
2. Update the `version` field in `deno.json` (e.g., `1.2.3`).
3. (Optionally) Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes.
4. Create a git tag matching the new version (e.g., `v1.2.3`):
   ```sh
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```
5. The release workflow will:
   - Ensure the latest CI on `main` is green
   - Run checks again
   - Publish the package to [JSR](https://jsr.io/@andreivarapayeu/oauth-one-a)
   - Create a GitHub Release with this tag

**Note:** No automatic release or publication happens on push to `main` â€” only when you push a new tag.

## Usage

Use [OAuthClient][doc-OAuthClient] object to sign an HTTP request with consumer
and token credentials. You get an `Authorization` header that can be added to an
actual request.

```typescript
import * as oauth from "jsr:@andreivarapayeu/oauth-one-a";

const client = new oauth.OAuthClient({
  consumer: {
    key: "appkey-0123456789abcdef",
    secret: "appsecret-00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff",
  },
  signature: oauth.HMAC_SHA1,
});

const auth = oauth.toAuthHeader(client.sign(
  "PATCH",
  "https://api.example.com/profile",
  {
    token: {
      key: "userkey-abcdef0123456789",
      secret: "usersecret-aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899",
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({ status: "busy" }),
  },
));

console.log("Authorization:", auth);
```
